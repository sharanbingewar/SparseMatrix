# SparseMatrix
Sparse matrices are two-dimensional arrays where most elements are zero. They optimize memory and computation by storing only non-zero elements along with their positions. Common representations include using arrays to track the row, column, and value of each non-zero element, thus avoiding the storage of zeroes.
